## Handoff Documentation Template

Use this template when transitioning work between roles:

**From**: [Role Name]  
**To**: [Role Name]  
**Date**: [Date]  
**Project/Feature**: [Name]

**Context**:
- Brief description of work completed
- Current status

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] List of artifacts/documents being handed off
- [ ] Relevant links (PRs, design files, test plans, etc.)

**Key Information**:
- Important decisions made
- Known issues or risks
- Dependencies or blockers

**Next Steps**:
- Expected actions for receiving role
- Timeline or deadlines

**Follow-up**:
- Scheduled sync meeting or check-in
- Point of contact for questions

## Best Practices for Smooth Handoffs

1. **Document Early and Often**: Don't wait until handoff to document; maintain clear notes throughout
2. **Schedule Transition Meetings**: Face-to-face (or video) handoffs are more effective than documentation alone
3. **Use Consistent Templates**: Standard formats make it easier to find information
4. **Maintain a RACI Matrix**: Clear Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed roles for each activity
5. **Create Overlap Periods**: When possible, allow roles to work together during transitions
6. **Feedback Loops**: Follow up after handoffs to ensure receiving party has what they need
7. **Update Project Board**: Ensure tickets and tasks clearly indicate current owner and status

## Escalation Paths

If handoffs are blocked or unclear:
1. **Immediate**: Raise in daily standup or direct communication between roles
2. **Within 24 hours**: Escalate to Project Manager for facilitation
3. **If still unresolved**: Product Lead coordinates resolution between roles
4. **Critical blockers**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues

## Continuous Improvement

During retrospectives, specifically discuss:
- Were handoffs clear and timely?
- What information was missing during transitions?
- How can we improve documentation or processes?
- Are there new templates or checklists needed?

Track handoff-related action items and review in weekly PM syncs.
