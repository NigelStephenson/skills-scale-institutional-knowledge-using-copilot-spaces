# OctoAcme Project Management — Quick Start

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management framework. This guide provides a concise overview of how we deliver customer-focused, iterative projects using clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our approach emphasizes small, testable increments with defined roles including Project Managers (PMs) who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers (PdMs) who define outcomes and prioritize work, Developers who build and test features, QA Leads who ensure quality standards and testing coverage, UX Designers who create user-centered solutions, Release Managers who coordinate safe deployments, Support/Customer Success Representatives who advocate for customer needs, and engaged Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Every project follows a structured lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, supported by key artifacts such as a Project Charter (one-pager), prioritized backlog, project board, Definition of Done (DoD), risk register, and release notes.

Projects begin with initiation where we validate the business need using a one-pager that captures the problem statement, success metrics, stakeholders, and timeline. Once approved, planning transforms this into an actionable backlog with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a release timeline. During execution, teams follow a consistent rhythm: daily standups to address blockers, weekly delivery syncs between PM and PdM, regular demos at sprint or milestone completion, and monthly stakeholder updates. The project board tracks work through columns (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done), while pull requests follow conventions including small changesets, automated CI testing and linting, and required code reviews. Quality is maintained through unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and security scanning, with velocity and burndown metrics tracked alongside the success measures defined in the project one-pager.

Risk management and communication are central to our process. Teams maintain a risk register with impact, likelihood, ownership, and mitigation plans, reviewing it weekly and escalating blockers through defined paths (team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor). Communication follows structured templates for weekly status updates highlighting progress, next steps, risks, and decisions needed. Releases follow standardized procedures with pre-release requirements including passing CI, drafted release notes, smoke tests, and documented rollback plans. Deployments proceed through staging verification before production, with post-deploy checks and stakeholder announcements.

Every project concludes with a retrospective to capture "what went well" and "what could be improved," producing 2–3 prioritized action items with clear owners and due dates. These improvements are tracked in the backlog and reviewed in weekly PM syncs, fostering a culture of continuous learning and iterative enhancement. For detailed guidance on any phase, refer to the comprehensive documentation: project initiation, planning, execution and tracking, risk and communication management, release and deployment procedures, retrospectives, and role definitions.
